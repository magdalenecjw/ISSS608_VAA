# Task

In this Take Home Exercise, age-sex pyramids across nine selected planning areas in trellis display are created using Tableau Desktop.

# Data Source

The data "*Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Age Group, Sex and Type of Dwelling, June 2022*" used for this Take Home Exercise is obtained from the [Department of Statistics, Singapore](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/find-data/search-by-theme/population/geographic-distribution/latest-data) in csv format.

# Creating the Analytical Visualization on Tableau

1.  Load the csv file into Tableau as follows: **Connect To a File** \> **Text file**.

    ![Fig 1](images/Loading_csv-01.jpg){fig-align="left"}

2.  In a new **Worksheet**, Age (field: "**AG**") is plotted against Population (field: "**Pop**") by Gender (field: "**Sex**").

    Since Age is already grouped into bins, this field can be used as-is in the **Row** shelf. The age groups are sorted in descending order as follows: right-click on **AG** \> **Sort** \> Sort by **Data Source Order - Descending**.

    ![Fig 2](images/Age_group_row_shelf.jpg){fig-align="left"}

3.  For a neater look of the final chart, the age group labels are amended to remove the underscores (\_) as follows: **Data** pane \> right-click on **AG** \> **Aliases** \> amend labels accordingly.

    ![Fig 3](images/Edit_aliases.jpg){width="261" fig-align="left"}

4.  Prior to creating the age-sex pyramid chart, the Population field will need to be split out - one field for each Gender as follows: **Analysis** \> **Create Calculated Field**.

    The first calculated field **MalePop** is created using the following formula:

    `IF [Sex]='Males' THEN [Pop] END`

    ![Fig 4a](images/MalePop.jpg){width="300" fig-align="left"}

    Similarly, asecond calculated field **FemalePop** is created with the following formula:

    `IF [Sex]='Females' THEN [Pop] END`

    ![Fig 4b](images/FemalePop.jpg){width="300" fig-align="left"}

5.  The two new fields **MalePop** and **FemalePop** are then dragged to the **Column** shelf.

    ![Fig 5](images/Pop_col_shelf.jpg){fig-align="left"}

6.  To create the age-sex pyramid, right-click on the axis for **MalePop** to reverse it. The axis title is also renamed to "Male".

    ![Fig 6](images/Male_axis-02.jpg){width="243" fig-align="left"}

7.  Likewise, the axis title for **FemalePop** is renamed as "Female". In the **Marks** card for the aggregation **SUM(FemalePop)**, the colour is also adjusted to pink to display a contrast against **MalePop**.

    ![Fig 7](images/Female_color-02.jpg){fig-align="left"}

8.  For the trellis display, age-sex pyramids will be shown for the Top 9 Planning Areas by Population Size.

    To do this, a calculated field **Top9PA (measure)** is created with the following formula to compute the total population size for each planning area.

    `{FIXED [PA]: SUM([Pop])}`

    ![Fig 8a](images/Top9PA.jpg){width="300" fig-align="left"}

    This calculated field is then duplicated as a dimension field (**Top9PA (dimension)**) in order to be used as a filter to identify the top 9 planning areas. The dimension field is dragged to the **Filters** shelf \> **Top** \> By field: **Top 9** by **Top9PA (dimension) - Sum**.

    ![Fig 8b](images/Top9PA_filter.jpg){width="244" fig-align="left"}

9.  **PA** is dragged to the **Column** shelf and sorted in descending order: right-click on **PA** \> **Sort** \> Sort by **Field - Descending - Field Name: Top9PA (measure) - Aggregation: Sum**.

    ![Fig 9a](images/dashboard_sort.jpg){fig-align="left"}

    For a neater look of the final chart, the field labels for the columns are hidden as follows: right-click on field label **PA** \> **Hide Field Labels for Columns**.

    ![Fig 9b](images/dashboard_hidelabels.jpg){fig-align="left"}

10. Lastly, the Sheet Name, and consequently the Sheet Title, is renamed to **Age-Sex Pyramid (for Top 9 Planning Areas by Population Size)** before it is saved to [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/views/TakeHome_Ex01/Age-SexPyramidforTop9PlanningAreasbyPopulationSize?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).

# Patterns observed in this Analytical Visualization

![](images/image-15177974.png){fig-align="left"}

Across the top nine planning areas by population size, none of the age-sex pyramids are expansive in nature. This trend is expected of a highly urbanized country such as Singapore, where there is high life expectancy and low mortality and fertility rates.

With the exception of Punggol and Seng Kang, most of the top planning areas are observed to have constrictive age-sex pyramids, characterized by urn-shaped graphs with a narrow base. This observation is likely to be attributed to the presence of highly mature housing estates in these planning areas. Notably, Bedok, Tampines and Hougang appear to be slightly "older" estates as a greater number of elderly (aged 70 and over) are observed to reside in these planning areas.

In contrast, Punggol and Seng Kang appear more characteristic of newer and younger housing estates where bulk of the population falls within two groups: 30-49 years and 0-19 years. This is likely due to the trend of younger couples moving to newer housing estates like Punggol and Seng Kang over the past decade to start their own families.

Between genders, population trends appear largely similar across the top planning areas. However, among the extremely old (80 and older), the female population is observed to be greater than the male population. This trend is aligned with global and local trends of a gender gap in life expectancy.
